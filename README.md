# Mindset Journal

## Objective:
---
Using Python, flask, MongoDB, create and app using CRUD. Mindset Journal is a gratitude journal based on recent requirements from a therapist/health coach. Mindset Journal provides an accessible viewpoint to journal 3 positive things every day, write notes or a journal entry and offer a public affirmation. The user will be able to privately access their entries with their username, they will have the option for their affirmations to be public. The user can read, update and delete their entries. The goal is to create a community with affirmations and to provide a tool for my therapist to give her clients to consistently collect three positive gratitudes a day. The gratitudes and journal entries can be referenced by the users at their appointment.

# Planning & Design


### Planning and Design
---
## Scope 

Mindset Journal is a site featuring clean and calming design elements and UX to provide a space to create and collect diary and gratitude entries for a wellbeing practice. The site provides users with a homepage, login, register pages, a personalised profile page, journal and gratitude pages and more. This app is simply designed as an accessible tool for users and their therapist. The user must be able to create diary and gratitude entries, edit them or delete them. The user is able to refer to past entries to see their growth as they progress with their habit of journaling and gratitudes. This is beneficial for the therapist to reflect upon to point their client in the right direction for their treatment. 

## Structure 

The layout is simple. Homepage, Register, Login, Write Journal, Edit journal, Journal, Write Gratitude, Edit Gratitude and Delete gratitude. Design is uniform to accomodate those with neurodiversity, stress and depression.
  
## Skeleton 

The Mindset Journal site was planned out with mockup wireframes using Balsamiq. They are as follow:

### Colors

To create an inclusive site I chose calming colors that would be less influencial in a target demographic way and journals are more marketed to women and I wanted Mindset Journal to be attractive to everyone as the objective it to help people of all walks of life to practive mindfulness with journalling and gratitudes alongside therapy.

The colors I used are a natural grey/blue with some warmer neutral textures:

#82b0b4 - light grey blue to use to highlight text.

#0d1922 - a softer black with tones of blue for the majority of text and forms to create a visual contrast for better UX.

#fafafa - the classic warmer white color for the background and navbar to enhance contrast against the text and to be less harsh on the eyes. 

### Images

I collected images to use as accents across the site. I didn't want the app to look too cluttered or stimulating to distract the user from the main purpose of the app. The images I use bring a complementary warmth the the color scheme with gold and warm beige. I focused on finding images with natural elements for a soft sensory effect to promote a calmness for users on the site. I used texture close-ups of wool, linen and paintings. 

### Fonts

For a modern, editorial effect, I looked at clean and effective sites and was incluenced a lot by Vogue.com. I used a cursive bigger font called Yeseva One for most headings to add some weight to the design. With most of the structure of the site's forms being an almost navy-black, I wanted the main font to be an elegant and modern font to soften the design and maintain a visual balance, for this I sued Darker Grotesque from Google Fonts. Where I needed a little more definition on the profile page for the journal and gratitude buttons, I used Gill Sans as it looks a little stronger against a background image.
