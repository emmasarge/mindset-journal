Using Python, flask, MongoDB, create and app using CRUD. Mindset Journal is a gratitude journal based on recent requirements from a therapist/health coach. Mindset Journal provides an accessible viewpoint to journal 3 positive things every day, write notes or a journal entry and offer a public affirmation. The user will be able to privately access their entries with their username, they will have the option for their affirmations to be public. The user can read, update and delete their entries. The goal is to create a community with affirmations and to provide a tool for my therapist to give her clients to consistently collect three positive gratitudes a day. The gratitudes and journal entries can be referenced by the users at their appointment.

# UX
### Project Objectives
Mindset is an accessible app for therapists and health coaches to use with their clients. It can also be used by anyone for their way to journal and practice gratitude and follow their entries over a period of time. The website provides privacy so no one other than the admin can access the entries. The secondary purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of backend technologies using Python, Flask and MongoDB.

# Planning & Design


### Planning and Design
---
## Scope 

Empty Pantry is a site with featuring contemporary design and UX to provide recipes with a basic ingredient search with MealDB Api. The site is built with four responsive pages: a landing page, recipe search page, about page and contact page. The contact page is supported by EmailJs API with an automatic reply message for users to feel acknowledged after sending their initial message. I wanted to create a visual experience with the landing page of a modern kitchen, the recipe page being very simple and intuitive and the rest of the site to be fresh with green and simplicity. 

## Structure 

I plan to keep the layout of the website to be very simple with a popular hamburger style of navigation bar and footer. Each page will be clean and intuitive for the user using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript where appropriate. 
  
## Skeleton 

The Mindset Journal site was planned out with mockup wireframes using Balsamiq. They are as follows:
