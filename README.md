# Mindset Journal

## Objective:
---
Using Python, flask, MongoDB, create and app using CRUD. Mindset Journal is a gratitude journal based on recent requirements from a therapist/health coach. Mindset Journal provides an accessible viewpoint to journal 3 positive things every day, write notes or a journal entry and offer a public affirmation. The user will be able to privately access their entries with their username, they will have the option for their affirmations to be public. The user can read, update and delete their entries. The goal is to create a community with affirmations and to provide a tool for my therapist to give her clients to consistently collect three positive gratitudes a day. The gratitudes and journal entries can be referenced by the users at their appointment.
